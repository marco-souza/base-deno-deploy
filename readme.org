* Base deno deploy project

  This project implements a basic example of a deno deploy API, using oak lib.

  deployed at:[[https://base-deno-deploy.deno.dev/][https://base-deno-deploy.deno.dev/]] 

** development

   This projects depends on:
   - [[https://deno.land/][Deno]]
   - [[https://velociraptor.run/][Velociraptor]]
   - [[https://deno.com/deploy/docs/deployctl][deployctl]]

   After installing these dependendencies, just run:

   #+begin_src shell
     vr start
     # Listening on http://0.0.0.0:8080
   #+end_src

   This should start locally the server at port ~8080~.

** usage

   You can call the dummy endpoints:
   - ~http://localhost:8080/forums/1/posts~
   - ~http://localhost:8080/forums/1/posts/1~

   or you can test the deployed version:
   - ~https://base-deno-deploy.deno.dev/forums/1/posts~
   - ~https://base-deno-deploy.deno.dev/forums/1/posts/1~

** notes
   - deno deploy doesn't support ~import_map.json~
   - deno deploy breaks with type checking, so I had to disable it
